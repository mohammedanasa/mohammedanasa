I work on applied and research-oriented machine learning, focusing on **large language models**, **deep learning**, and **AI systems engineering**. My interests include:

- Large-scale model fine-tuning and adaptation  
- RAG systems and retrieval-based reasoning  
- Deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing  
- Efficient inference, quantization, and model optimization  
- MLOps for reliable, reproducible machine learning  

I enjoy building systems that bridge research and production — transforming theoretical advances into deployable, high-impact applications.

## Selected Work & Projects

### LLM Fine-Tuning & Quantization  
Adaptation of open-weight LLMs using Q-LoRA and 4-bit quantization. Implemented full fine-tuning pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and optimized inference stacks using FastAPI and LangChain. Integrated RAG for domain-specific knowledge reasoning.

### Retrieval-Augmented Support Assistant  
End-to-end retrieval system using vector databases and encoder models. Converts technical documentation into structured, searchable representations. Achieved high-precision, context-aware responses using LangChain agents and custom retrieval logic.

### Autonomous Multi-Agent System (CrewAI)  
Developed a multi-agent reasoning architecture for analysis, content generation, and decision support. Combined retrieval, planning, and LLM-based reasoning in a modular framework.

### Computer Vision: Lane & Object Detection  
Implemented classical and deep-learning-based CV pipelines. Built YOLO-based object detection and lane detection systems optimized for real-time performance.

### MLOps for Intrusion Detection  
End-to-end anomaly detection pipeline with experiment tracking (MLFlow), data versioning (DVC), and automated training/deployment via CI/CD. Ensured reproducibility and reliability across the ML lifecycle.
